# Send-Encrypted-and-Authenticated-Message
A small scale real-world application that incorporates the principles of secure computing including cryptography, network security, and data protection using third-party Python libraries. Applies Python towards several contemporary programming requirements and techniques involving secure, distributed, and parallel computing to Send Authenticated Message to Boss using HMAC with Encryption page.


First, develop the database for a small scale real-world applications using third-party Python libraries.

1) In a single Python script:

DDL for the table
DML for the table
Use Cursor results from a Select statement to display the information from all the rows in the table
DDL Script Requirements:
You must have a drop table command at the top of your script to drop the table in your database. 
You must have a create table statement 
Your table must contain the following attributes: AgentId, AgentName, AgentAlias, AgentSecurityLevel, and LoginPassword
Your table create script must properly define AgentId as the primary key.
Your script must run to completion without errors.
DML Script Requirements:
Your script must create at least 6 rows of data in the table created above with relevant data.
Use Cursor results from a Select statement to display the information from all the rows in the table
2) In a different Python script:

This script must contain the following: 

A deletion SQL statement that only deletes at least 1 row but not all rows of data in your table.
An update SQL statement for each table that only updates attributes for at least 1 row but not all rows of data in your table. 
A select statement that selects data from a single table;
A select statement that selects data from a single table that limits the columns returned;
A select statement that selects data from a single table that limits the rows returned;
A select statement that selects data from a single table that limits both the columns and the rows returned;


Then develop a frontend application that interacts with a database for a small scale real-world applications using third-party Python libraries discussed in the course.
Solve a simple programming problem based on various approaches to computer security and information management.



Now, Using Python and the Flask library, create a Flask website with the following pages

Home
Add a new Secret Agent
List Secret Agents
Results



Develop code that encrypts data stored in a database for a small scale using third-party Python libraries discussed in the course.
Solve a simple programming problem based on various approaches to computer security and information management.
Build a small scale real-world application that incorporates the principles of secure computing including cryptography, network security, and data protection.
Using Python and the flask.session, flask.flash, and os libraries to implement Role Based Access Control from the Flask website. 



Develop code that encrypts data stored in a database for a small scale using third-party Python libraries discussed in the course.
Solve a simple programming problem based on various approaches to computer security and information management.
Build a small scale real-world application that incorporates the principles of secure computing including cryptography, network security, and data protection.
Using Python and the Crypto.Cipher, Cryptodome.Cipher, or Cryptodomex.Cipher library create a database creation and encrypt data in tables.
Now Encrypt and Decrypt Data coming from database on Frond end App

Change the following logic to the following pages in your Flask website 

Login - (data values for the following fields AgentName and LoginPassword should be encrypted before they are used to the query the table. However, the name displayed on the login screen should be decrypted.).




Use Python and the sockerserver,  socket, and sys libraries to Send Encrypted Message to Boss


Use Python and the hmac, hashlib, and pycryptodome libraries to Send Authenticated Message to Boss using HMAC with Encryption page and 
Boss using HMAC with Encryption Server
